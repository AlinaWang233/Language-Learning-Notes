Concepts:
- MVP: minimum viable product for **iterativity** vs. final perfect product in waterfall model
- Sprint: 1-4 week period with planning & retro meeting to plan and summarize the current sprint; make sure every sprint produces any feature, and the developing direction is within control
- Scrum Team: 
  - a product owner manages requests and the whole team
  - a scrum master manages the sprint progress and individual tasks for each member
  - several developers to develop the product
    - TDD(Test-Driven Development), pair programming
  - serveral quality assurance to test the product 
    - A/B testing, canary in pilot
- Daily Standup Meeting: 10 min meeting everday before work for each member to report its progress (tasks finished yesterday, goals for today, any risks encountered) to make sure every member has a sense of others' progress and control risks


## Design
### Figma
Adavantages:
- all platform(unlike sketch that only supports mac)
- save on cloud
- retrieve history versions (free - 30 days, membership - forever)
- real-time collaboration(through a link) & discussion
